I'm Jacob, a Ph.D. candidate in the Department of Physics and Astronomy at 
Johns Hopkins University. My research has used data from the Gaia satellite
to reveal new insights into the evolution of exoplanet systems. Using data from Gaia,
we can determine the velocities of stars in the Milky Way. In turn, we can use these 
velocities to infer the relative age of different populations of stars. I use these relative ages
to study how exoplanet systems evolve due to tidal interactions between stars and planets. You can 
papers on [ADS](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/search/q=%22Hamer%2C%20Jacob%20H.%22%20year%3A2016-&sort=date%20desc%2C%20bibcode%20desc&p_=0).

I'm passionate about science communication, especially observatory-based outreach
and interactive data visualizations. While I was Observatory Fellow for Maryland 
Space Grant Consortium, I authored several interactive blog posts on 
[ObservableHQ](https://observablehq.com/@jhhamer?tab=notebooks&publishLevel=public&sort=edited&direction=desc). I also mentored a 
JHU undergraduate, and together we produced a planetarium show 
on the transit and doppler methods for detecting exoplanets, available on 
[YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vlDmQSgOK8).
